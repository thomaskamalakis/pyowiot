# pyowiot
This is an open-source Python library that can be used to design optical wireless systems for internet-of-things (IoT) applications

# Funding support
We wrote this code under COST action NewFocus CA19111.

# What is all about?
We can use this library to simulate a typical optical wireless system used for IoT. We assume a master node (MN) placed somewhere in a room (preferably the ceiling). The master node uses visible light communications (VLC) to send acknowledgment messages to sensor nodes (SNs) also placed inside the room.
